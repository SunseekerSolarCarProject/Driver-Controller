# Driver Controller
This code runs on the driver controller board of the Sunseeker solar car.

## Notice
This was written using Code Composer Studio, and that IDE's built in compiling/debuging features. We are currently working out the kinks to make this compile/debug with `msp430-gcc` and `mspdebug`.

## TODO
- Workout `msp430-gcc` and `mspdebug` kinks
- Update (rewrite) for 2016 car
  - Write tests first!

## Versioning Scheme

`year`.`major`.`minor`.`relese`
